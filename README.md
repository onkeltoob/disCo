disCo
=====

This jQuery plugin provides functionality to display your record collection at 
http://www.discogs.com. It basically creates a simple table with a configurable 
number of releases from one of your folders (with the default value pointing to 
"All releases").

Settings and additional information

Due to formatting problems I put the available settings and some more stuff on my site:

This jQuery plugin provides functionality to display your record collection at 
http://www.discogs.com. It basically creates a simple table with a configurable 
number of releases from one of your folders (with the default value pointing to 
"All releases"). The generated table uses an "id" attribute set to "records", so 
you better don't use this value for any other element on your page. There's probably 
a better way to create the table; I just don't want to spend time on this topic.

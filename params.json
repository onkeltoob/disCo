{"name":"disCo","body":"# Welcome to the disCo\r\n\r\ndisCo is a jQuery plugin that enables you to display your (or anyone else's) record collection hosted on [Discogs](http://www.discogs.com). If you haven't heard of Discogs, own a lot of music, and are at least a little nerdy you should seriously consider going there and putting your stuff together. The process of this is super comfortable, so it won't take too long (depending on the size of your collection). Once you're done you'll most definately feel the urge to let anyone know what you possess. And yes - size does matter.\r\n\r\nIf you own a website and want to show off your collection or at least your latest purchases (because you're that super famous DJ getting tons of new material every week), you can use disCo exactly for that.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIt's a jQuery plugin, so simply using it is pretty basic stuff: [get the plugin](https://github.com/papatoob/disCo) and put it some place reasonable within your site structure. After that, reference the resource like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script src='/path/to/jquery.toob.disCo.js'></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere have been discussions where exactly to put this line of code for  long time. I'm not an expert and don't want to judge or even argue, so I decided to put it at the end of my page (so loading it won't block anything, I guess).\r\n\r\nTwo steps left. First, create a `<div class=\"myRecords\">` element. You can put as much content in there as you like, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"myRecords\" data-user=\"papatoob\">\r\n\t<h3>My latest records</h3>\r\n\t<p>Here's what I recently added to my collection.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will realize the additional attribute `data-user=\"papatoob\"` in there. This attribute tells the plugin whose collection to display. By specifying this for each element directly and not hard coding it within the plugin settings you're able to apply the plugin to multiple elements for different users with just one call. If you want or need to, you can use a different `data-` attribute; there's an option for this within the plugin's settings.\r\n\r\nThe resulting table will always be inserted at the end of the root element (the div you just created). And now finally call the plugin to work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script>\r\n\t$(document).ready(function () {\r\n\t\t$('.myRecords').disCo({results: 5});\r\n\t});\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is what you get (on [my site](http://tobias-reinhardt.de/discogs-collection-plugin) with some styling):\r\n![Screenshot of generated records table](http://tobias-reinhardt.de/img/disco.png)\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\n\r\nThere's a couple of settings available that have some effect on the output of the plugin's work:\r\n\r\n* `userAttributeName`: The name of the data-attribute containing the username. You can either specify the complete attribute name (e.g. \"data-discogsuser\") or simply the second part (\"discogsuser\"). Default value: `\"user\"`\r\n* `folder`: The ID of the folder you want to display records from. For now Discogs seems to allow folder requests only for the default folder containing all releases, so this option doesn't really make sense. Default value: `0`, so all releases are targeted\r\n* `sort`: Sort column. Discogs only allows very few values here (\"added\", \"artist\", \"label\",...). Default value: `\"added\"`\r\n* `sortOrder`: Sort order (\"asc\", \"desc\"). Default value: `\"desc\"`\r\n* `results`: The number of results to be displayed. Beware: The larger the number, the more requests to Discogs will be made! Default value: `10`\r\n* `resultElementClass`: Class attribute for the entire result table or paragraph (if no results are found). Default value: `\"records\"`\r\n* `resultElementId`: ID for the entire result table or paragraph (if no results are found). Default value: `\"\"`\r\n* `headerId`: The release ID column name. Default value: `\"ID\"`\r\n* `headerArtists`: The artists column name. Default value: `\"Artists\"`\r\n* `headerTitle`: The title column name. Default value: `\"Title\"`\r\n* `headerLabels`: The record labels column name. Default value: `\"Labels\"`\r\n* `headerStyles`: The styles column name. Default value: `\"Styles\"`\r\n* `headerYear`: The year column name (for the year of the release). Default value: `\"Year\"`\r\n* `noReleasesNote`: Text to be displayed if no releases are found. Default value: `\"No releases could be found.\"`\r\n\r\n## What's next\r\n\r\nI do have [some ideas regarding additional features](http://tobias-reinhardt.de/discogs-collection-plugin#ideas), but usually - after having achieved what I initially wanted to - I do not get back to those. But I'd of course be very happy about any contributions!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

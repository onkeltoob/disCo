        <h1>Welcome to the disCo</h1>

<p>disCo is a jQuery plugin that enables you to display your (or anyone else's) record collection hosted on <a href="http://www.discogs.com">Discogs</a>. If you haven't heard of Discogs, own a lot of music, and are at least a little nerdy you should seriously consider going there and putting your stuff together. The process of this is super comfortable, so it won't take too long (depending on the size of your collection). Once you're done you'll most definately feel the urge to let anyone know what you possess. And yes - size does matter.</p>

<p>If you own a website and want to show off your collection or at least your latest purchases (because you're that super famous DJ getting tons of new material every week), you can use disCo exactly for that.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>It's a jQuery plugin, so simply using it is pretty basic stuff: <a href="https://github.com/papatoob/disCo">get the plugin</a> and put it some place reasonable within your site structure. After that, reference the resource like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">'/path/to/jquery.toob.disCo.js'</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>There have been discussions where exactly to put this line of code for  long time. I'm not an expert and don't want to judge or even argue, so I decided to put it at the end of my page (so loading it won't block anything, I guess).</p>

<p>Two steps left. First, create a <code>&lt;div class="myRecords"&gt;</code> element. You can put as much content in there as you like, for example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"myRecords"</span> <span class="na">data-user=</span><span class="s">"papatoob"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;h3&gt;</span>My latest records<span class="nt">&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Here's what I recently added to my collection.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You will realize the additional attribute <code>data-user="papatoob"</code> in there. This attribute tells the plugin whose collection to display. By specifying this for each element directly and not hard coding it within the plugin settings you're able to apply the plugin to multiple elements for different users with just one call. If you want or need to, you can use a different <code>data-</code> attribute; there's an option for this within the plugin's settings.</p>

<p>The resulting table will always be inserted at the end of the root element (the div you just created). And now finally call the plugin to work:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
    <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">ready</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'.myRecords'</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">disCo</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="nx">results</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">});</span>
    <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>And here is what you get (on <a href="http://tobias-reinhardt.de/discogs-collection-plugin">my site</a> with some styling):

<h3>Wantlist</h3>

<p>You can also show off your wantlist data now (this might come in handy the closer you get to your next birthday). Just use another data attribute on your container element for this: <code>data-collection="wantlist"</code>. As with the data-user attribute above you can change the name of the attribute within the settings.</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>There's a couple of settings available that have some effect on the output of the plugin's work, here they are including their default values:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>userAttributeName: "user"</code> The name of the data-attribute containing the username. You can either specify the complete attribute name (e.g. "data-discogsuser") or simply the second part ("discogsuser").</li>
<li>
<code>collectionAttributeName: "collection"</code> The name of the data-attribute containing the type of collection you want to retrieve. Value "wantlist" will retrieve the user's wantlist data, everything else will return the collection. Therefore, you don't have to use the attribute nor the setting if you want to show only your collection data.</li>
<li>
<code>folder: 0</code> The ID of the folder you want to display records from. For now Discogs seems to allow folder requests only for the default folder containing all releases, so this option doesn't really make sense.</li>
<li>
<code>sort: "added"</code> Sort column. Discogs only allows very few values here ("added", "artist", "label",...).</li>
<li>
<code>sortOrder: "desc"</code> Sort order ("asc", "desc").</li>
<li>
<code>results: 10</code> The number of results to be displayed. Beware: The larger the number, the more requests to Discogs will be made!</li>
<li>
<code>resultElementClass: "records"</code> Class attribute for the entire result table or paragraph (if no results are found).</li>
<li>
<code>resultElementId: ""</code> ID for the entire result table or paragraph (if no results are found).</li>
<li>
<code>headerId: "ID"</code> The release ID column name.</li>
<li>
<code>headerArtists: "Artists"</code> The artists column name.</li>
<li>
<code>headerTitle: "Title"</code> The title column name.</li>
<li>
<code>headerLabels: "Labels"</code> The record labels column name.</li>
<li>
<code>headerStyles: "Styles"</code> The styles column name.</li>
<li>
<code>headerYear: "Year"</code> The year column name (for the year of the release).</li>
<li>
<code>noReleasesNote: "No releases found."</code> Text to be displayed if no releases are found.</li>
<li>
<code>autoReserveHeight: false</code> If set to true the approximate height of the result table will be calculated and applied within a style attribute so "content flickering" (or rather "content moving") will be minimized. This setting is highly experimental as there can't be a global line-height factor for  every site using the plugin. Therefore, the height of an "average" result line needs to be somehow  calculated. As long as there is no way of doing this, I chose a default height of 25px per row.</li>
</ul><h2>What's next</h2>

<p>I do have <a href="http://tobias-reinhardt.de/discogs-collection-plugin#ideas">some ideas regarding additional features</a>, but usually - after having achieved what I initially wanted to - I do not get back to those. But I'd of course be very happy about any contributions!</p>
